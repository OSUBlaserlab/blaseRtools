\description{
Will copy and rename  the files and generate two files:  "blinding_key.csv" with the original and blinded file names, and "scoresheet.csv" with just the blinded filenames.  Add columns as needed to scoresheet, for example, runx_count.  Then run bb_unblind to rejoin scoresheet to the key and generate an unblinded result file.
